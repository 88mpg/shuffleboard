# DEPRECATED - NEW VERSION CURRENTLY BEING BUILT PRIVATE

### Get started
1. Have a somewhat recent version of node/npm installed
1. `npm install`

### Dev and build
Run dev server on `localhost:8000`: `npm run serve`

Build bundle and assets to `/gh-pages`: `npm run build`

We should publish `gh-pages` on `master` to update the github.io page.

Don't send a dead biscuit to the kitchen.
